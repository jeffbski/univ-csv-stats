is there an easy way to convert all attributes in a struct?
let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };

	only works if they are the same names and types
	https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-01-defining-structs.html

is .into() needed?

is wasm calculate_stats_from_file work?, I don't think we have file access

add string to struct
